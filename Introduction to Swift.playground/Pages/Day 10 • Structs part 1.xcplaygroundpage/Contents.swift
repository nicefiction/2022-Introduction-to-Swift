/// When should you use a computed property or a stored property?
/// https://www.hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/understanding-swift/when-should-you-use-a-computed-property-or-a-stored-property
///PERFORMANCE
///If you regularly read the property when its value hasn’t changed,
///then using a stored property will be much faster than using a computed property.
///On the other hand,
///if your property is read very rarely and perhaps not at all,
///then using a computed property saves you from having to calculate its value and store it somewhere.
///DEPENDENCY
///When it comes to dependencies
///— whether your property’s value relies on the values of your other properties —
///then the tables are turned:
///this is a place where computed properties are useful,
///because you can be sure the value they return always takes into account the latest program state.
///NOTE
///`Lazy properties` help mitigate the performance issues of _rarely read stored properties_,
///and `property observers` mitigate the dependency problems of stored properties
///— we’ll be looking at them soon.

/// SwiftUI uses `willSet` in some places to handle animations
/// so that it can take a snapshot of the user interface before a change.
/// When it has both the “before” and “after” snapshot,
/// it can compare the two to see all the parts of the user interface that need to be updated.
